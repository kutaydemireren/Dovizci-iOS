This was a 2 months project for my internship, Summer '15. Written in Objective-C. 

Other intern was responsible of Back-end and I was responsible for iOS. Project simply shows the selected currency rates with respect to Turkish Lira. Plus, you can set an alarm for a specific currency rate and have the news for currencies (although, the data for news was never supplied, so only a template can be seen).

This was my first iOS project, so I am aware that code quality is not good. Also, project might be get expired since this project was not developed further. You may need to update the packages if you want to run the project.
